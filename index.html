                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq1', this)">Q1: How long should I wait before rolling down my windows after tinting?<span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: After having your windows tinted, it's crucial to allow the film to cure properly. Typically, you should wait at least 2 to 4 days before rolling down your windows. This waiting period ensures that the tint adheres correctly to the glass, preventing any peeling or bubbling. Factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the curing time, so it's best to consult with your tinting professional for specific guidance.</div>

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: What causes window tint to bubble or turn purple over time? <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A:Bubbling or discoloration, such as turning purple, often results from the use of low-quality tint films that degrade over time due to exposure to UV rays. These issues are typically due to adhesive failure or the breakdown of dyes in the film. To avoid such problems, it's advisable to invest in high-quality, UV-resistant window films that are designed to withstand prolonged sun exposure without deteriorating.</div>
